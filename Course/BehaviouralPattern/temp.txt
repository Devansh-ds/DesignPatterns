Command

1) We can store all the operations in a seperate object. By creating an command interface
   which has execute() method wiht perform certain action. 
2) It is useful in undo/redo operations and when decoupling of object with instruction
   is required.

Mediator

1) If there is alot of talk between classes we can create a mediator which connects all
   the components instead of letting them dependent on each other directly. It makes It
   easier to send messages to all.
2) Some use cases are Event broker where multiple components subscribe to something to 
   get messages and other use case is chat room etc.

Memento

1) Mementos are used to roll back states. It is simply a token class with no setters or 
   we can say read only class where stores states.
2) It can be used to restore previous state by passing Memento into desired class as we
   say it act as undo/redo.
